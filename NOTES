Simple token-based authentication using local credentials

There are 3rd party based authentication strategies such as log in using FB or Google but we'll focus on the simplest, which is to use locally stored credientials.

To make this happen, we need 2 packages
1. passport ( the authentication package )
2. passport-local ( the authentication 'strategy' that lets us use locally stored credentials )
3. jsonwebtoken (this lets us validate tokens sent by clients
4. react-cookie (to be able to pass the tokens back to the server)
5. A secret string
